Verification of AMBA AXI3 Protocol using single master and single slave without using Design

The AMBA AXI3 protocol is a widely used on-chip communication bus protocol designed for high-performance communication in System-on-Chip (SoC) designs. ​ It features separate address/control and data phases, supports burst transactions, and allows for out-of-order transaction completion. ​
Key Features of AXI3 Protocol
The AXI3 protocol includes several advanced features that enhance its performance and flexibility. ​

> Separate address/control and data phases improve efficiency.
> Supports unaligned data transfers using byte strobes for incremental bursts.
> Allows burst-based transactions with only the start address issued. ​
> Enables multiple outstanding addresses and out-of-order transaction completion. ​
> Suitable for high-bandwidth and low-latency designs.
> Backward-compatible with existing AHB and APB interfaces. ​

Write Address Channel Signals
The write address channel consists of several key signals that facilitate write transactions. ​

AWID [3:0]: Identification tag for the write address group. ​
AWADDR [31:0]: Address of the first transfer in a write burst. ​
AWLEN [3:0]: Specifies the number of transfers in a burst. ​
AWSIZE [2:0]: Indicates the size of each transfer in the burst. ​
AWBURST [1:0]: Details how the address for each transfer is calculated. ​
AWVALID: Indicates valid write address and control information. ​
AWREADY: Indicates the slave is ready to accept the address. ​

Write Data Channel Signals
The write data channel includes signals that manage the transfer of data during write operations. ​

WID [3:0]: ID tag of the write data transfer. ​
WDATA [31:0]: The actual write data being transferred. ​
WSTRB [3:0]: Indicates which byte lanes to update in memory. ​
WLAST: Indicates the last transfer in a write burst. ​
WVALID: Indicates valid write data and strobes are available. ​
WREADY: Indicates the slave can accept the write data. ​

Write Response Channel Signals
The write response channel provides feedback on the status of write transactions. ​

BID [3:0]: Identification tag of the write response. ​
BRESP [1:0]: Indicates the status of the write transaction (OKAY, EXOKAY, SLVERR, DECERR). ​
BVALID: Indicates a valid write response is available. ​
BREADY: Indicates the master can accept the response.

Read Address Channel Signals
The read address channel manages the initiation of read transactions. ​

ARID [3:0]: Identification tag for the read address group. ​
ARADDR [31:0]: Initial address of a read burst transaction. ​
ARLEN [3:0]: Specifies the number of transfers in a read burst. ​
ARSIZE [2:0]: Indicates the size of each transfer in the burst. ​
ARBURST [1:0]: Details how the address for each transfer is calculated. ​
ARVALID: Indicates valid read address is available. ​
ARREADY: Indicates the slave is ready to accept the address. ​

Read Data/Response Channel Signals
The read data/response channel conveys the data and status of read transactions. ​

RID [3:0]: ID tag of the read data group. ​
RDATA [31:0]: The actual read data being transferred. ​
RRESP [1:0]: Indicates the status of the read transfer. ​
RLAST: Indicates the last transfer in a read burst. ​
RVALID: Indicates that the required read data is available. ​
RREADY: Indicates the master can accept the read data. ​

Handshake Mechanism in AXI3
The AXI3 protocol employs a VALID/READY handshake mechanism for data transfer.

The source generates the VALID signal to indicate data availability. ​
The destination generates the READY signal to indicate acceptance. ​
Transfer occurs only when both VALID and READY signals are HIGH. ​
There are three types of handshaking: Valid before Ready, Ready before Valid, and Valid with Ready. ​

Burst Transaction Types in AXI3
AXI3 supports three types of burst transactions: Fixed, Incrementing, and Wrapping. ​

Fixed Type: Address remains the same for every transfer. ​
Incrementing Burst: Address increments based on transfer size. ​
Wrapping Burst: Address wraps around to a lower address at a wrap boundary. ​

UVM-Based Testbench Architecture for AXI3
The UVM-based testbench architecture for AXI3 includes various components for effective verification. ​

The master agent initiates read and write transactions, generating addresses and control signals. ​
The slave agent responds to transactions, performing read/write operations and returning data. ​
The scoreboard compares transactions between master and slave, ensuring correctness. ​
Functional coverage mechanisms are integrated to track AXI3 parameters. ​

Challenges in AXI3 Verification
Several challenges arise during the verification of the AXI3 protocol. ​

Burst calculations require careful handling of address, length, and size. ​
Managing decoupled channels and concurrent operations can lead to protocol violations. ​
Timing violations and valid data collection in the monitor class need careful synchronization.
Transaction synchronization and pairing in the scoreboard are critical for accurate comparisons. ​

Conclusion on AXI3 Protocol Verification
The AXI3 protocol, when verified using a UVM testbench, demonstrates its robustness and flexibility. ​

The structured approach of UVM enables effective testing and validation of protocol compliance. ​
Functional and coverage-driven verification helps uncover corner cases and ensures correctness. ​
This setup accelerates the verification cycle and improves testbench scalability and maintainability. ​
